========================================

For auto renewal of certificate, place the files `opt/renew-certificates.sh` and `opt/le-droidrace.caglabs.se-webroot.ini`
in `/opt/`.

Run `renew-certificates.sh` as root in a cron job every third day or so to auto renew the cert when it's about to expire.
